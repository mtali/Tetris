# Tetris

## :scroll: Description

This project contains a fully functional Tetris game built entirely with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), a modern toolkit for building Android user interfaces. 
Players can use touchscreen gestures to control the movement and rotation of falling blocks, aiming to create complete horizontal lines to score points.
